/**
 * One document in, one reading out.
 *
 * The dispatch is here rather than in `tools.ts` so that the note each format
 * produces is written next to the reader that knows what it means. "All 12
 * pages" and "the whole body, without headers or footers" answer the same
 * question — did this reach the end of the document — in the only units their
 * format has.
 *
 * Every path returns something or raises. None of them returns an empty
 * success: an empty string reads as "the document is empty", which is a
 * different and much more damaging claim than "I could not read it".
 *
 * **The cut is the serializer's, not this file's.** Slicing a finished string
 * is unsafe against GFM — a table cut between its header and its divider is not
 * a table any more — so `blocksToMarkdown` spends the budget on block
 * boundaries and, inside a table, on row boundaries, and reports what did not
 * fit. Every block reader goes through `wrote()`; XLSX is the one exception,
 * because a worksheet budgets in whole rows of its own.
 *
 * **`omissions` is static plus observed.** The per-format list says what this
 * reader never looks at; `observed` says what *this document* actually lost —
 * a merged cell, a picture inside a table, a deck reordered after its slides
 * were named. The first is a property of the code and the second of the file,
 * and running them together is what lets a caller tell "never supported" from
 * "was here and could not be carried".
