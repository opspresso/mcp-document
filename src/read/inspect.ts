/**
 * A read document described rather than written.
 *
 * **A line grammar, not JSON**, and the reason is the cut. The caller bounds a
 * tool result at 100,000 characters; a truncated JSON document is a total loss,
 * because nothing before the cut can be read without repairing it, while a
 * truncated line grammar loses its last line and nothing else. Under a hard
 * ceiling the format whose *prefixes are valid* is the one to pick. The second
 * reason is the provenance header — `asUntrustedContent` prepends a paragraph
 * of prose, and prose in front of JSON is not JSON, so carrying it would mean
 * dropping the one injection mitigation this server states.
 *
 * The shape is `inspect_spreadsheet`'s, generalised from a scalar at an address
 * to a block at an ordinal:
 *
 *     0 break unit=slide n=1 name="Overview" part="ppt/slides/slide1.xml"
 *     1 heading level=1 style="제목1" chars=12 "2026년 사업 계획"
 *     3 list ordered items=4
 *     4   item depth=0 chars=18 "시장 점유율 확대"
 *     6 table rows=5 cols=3 header=stated align=left,right,right merged
 *     7   row header
 *     9     cell colspan=2 "2026년"
 *     11 image alt="조직도" target="word/media/image1.png"
 *
 * `chars` is the block's **true** length even when the preview was cut — the
 * per-block form of the `totalCells` the spreadsheet inspection has always
 * reported. A preview is JSON-quoted, so a newline or a quote inside it cannot
 * break the line it sits on.
