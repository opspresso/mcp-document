/**
 * The one claim every reader makes about itself: whether what came back is all
 * of it.
 *
 * `complete`, the note and `counts` are the only way a caller can tell a short
 * document from a long one that was cut, and the failure mode is silent in both
 * directions — a document that fits is reported the same way whether the reader
 * measured or guessed. The HWP path guessed: it serialized its own text against
 * the same budget, threw away what the serializer said about the cut, and then
 * had the truncation checked again on a string that could no longer be over the
 * limit. A 200,000-character document came back at 90,000 saying `complete:
 * true`, "all 1 section(s)" and "400 of 400 blocks" — four statements, none of
 * them true, and nothing downstream able to notice.
 *
 * So this asserts the contract from the outside, on a document built to be
 * larger than the budget, for the reader that had it wrong and for one that
 * always had it right.
