/**
 * What a document said, before it is written as anything.
 *
 * Not `markdown.ts`'s `Block`, and the difference is the direction. That union
 * is the greatest common denominator of what four renderers can *draw* — its
 * own header says so — and a reader's subject is what a file *contained*, which
 * no renderer bounds. Three of the kinds below prove it: a cell that spans
 * columns has no GFM syntax so `parseMarkdown` could never produce one, an
 * image is deliberately a link on that side (`tools.ts` refuses assets for HWPX
 * because "hwpx renders an image as a link"), and a slide boundary is a fact
 * about a deck rather than a thing to lay out.
 *
 * So the five kinds where a document and a renderer agree are imported by name
 * and used unchanged, and the shared inline vocabulary — `Run`, `ListItem`,
 * `Align` — is imported rather than restated. The two models meet at Markdown
 * text, which they already both speak: `blocksToMarkdown` writes `![alt](x)`
 * and `parseMarkdown` reads it back. Neither imports the other's union.
