/**
 * HWP 5.0 to text.
 *
 * The file is an OLE compound document. `FileHeader` states the version and a
 * flag word; the body is one deflate stream per `BodyText/SectionN`; and inside
 * each section is a flat sequence of records, of which exactly one tag carries
 * prose. So the work is three layers of container and one of text, and every
 * layer has a way of being *not* the thing it looks like — which is why each
 * one says what it found rather than returning nothing.
 *
 * Every Office binary from the 97-2003 generation is also an OLE compound
 * document, so `detect.ts` can only get as far as "compound file". Naming which
 * one it actually is happens here, off the directory this has to read anyway.
 *
 * The control-character table is the part worth checking against the spec. HWP
 * puts objects, fields and section definitions *inside* the paragraph's text as
 * control characters, and the extended ones occupy eight UTF-16 units rather
 * than one. Miscounting by a unit does not lose a character — it shifts the
 * rest of the paragraph by one and turns the whole thing into noise that still
 * looks like text.
