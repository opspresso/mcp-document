/**
 * The two layers inside an HWP body that decide what the document says: the
 * record walk, and the control-character accounting inside a paragraph.
 *
 * The accounting is the one worth the most attention. HWP stores objects,
 * fields and section definitions *inside* the text as control characters, and
 * the extended ones occupy eight UTF-16 units rather than one. A miscount does
 * not lose a character and does not throw — it shifts the rest of the paragraph
 * and returns noise that still looks like text, which nothing downstream can
 * detect.
