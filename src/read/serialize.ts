 * `markdown.ts`, where it is tested against the parser it has to invert.
 *
 * **The cut happens here, not in `document.ts`.** `truncateText` slices a
 * finished string, and against GFM that is unsafe: a table cut between its
 * header and its divider is not a table any more, and a row cut in half is a
 * row whose columns no longer line up — which is exactly the failure the
 * spreadsheet reader spends a budget in whole rows to avoid. So the budget is
 * spent on block boundaries, and inside a table on row boundaries, and what did
 * not fit is reported rather than left to be noticed.
