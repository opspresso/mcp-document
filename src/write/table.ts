/**
 * How wide each column of a table should be, as a share of the whole.
 *
 * Shared by the three renderers because it is the one table decision that is
 * about the *content* rather than about the format: an id column next to a
 * column of prose should not get half the table, and which unit the answer is
 * expressed in — points, twentieths of a point, HWPUNIT — is the only thing
 * that differs between them.
 *
 * Character counts rather than measured text: the three renderers measure in
 * three different fonts, and a column layout that changed with the format would
 * make the same document look like three documents. The clamp is what stops one
 * long cell from squeezing every other column down to a character per line.
