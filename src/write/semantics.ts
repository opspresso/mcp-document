/**
 * What a run of blocks *is*, recognised from its shape — with no format in it.
 *
 * Markdown says what to show and none of how; these functions read the
 * structure the author already wrote — three sub-headings with a line each, a
 * list of numbers, a lone block quote — and name the semantic that structure
 * was reaching for. The PPTX planner turns a semantic into a designed slide;
 * a page renderer may turn the same one into a styled block, or leave it as
 * the plain flow it already renders well. Recognition is shared; what to make
 * of it is each format's own decision.
 *
 * **Every rule here is conservative.** Content that does not match a pattern
 * *exactly* stays unrecognised, because a treatment forced onto content it
 * does not fit is worse than plain rendering — a "cards" slide with a code
 * block wedged into a card is how generated documents get their reputation.
 * When a rule says 2 to 4, a fifth card means the section was prose after all.
