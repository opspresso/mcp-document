/**
 * Markdown in, a presentation out — the deck's decisions, with no XML in them.
 *
 * A deck is a sequence of fixed-size boxes, so unlike the DOCX and HWPX writers
 * this planner has to decide **where a slide ends** — there is no reflow to fall
 * back on, and text past the bottom of a box is simply not on the screen.
 *
 * **A slide opens at a level 1 or 2 heading**, and the level says what opens.
 * A `#` that starts the document is the cover; a `#` later is a section
 * divider, numbered in the order the dividers appear; a `##` is an ordinary
 * content slide. Nothing else in Markdown says "new slide" — a horizontal
 * rule, which is what Marp uses, turns a decorative divider into a page break
 * in every document that was not written as a deck. Level 3 and below stay in
 * the body as sub-headings.
 *
 * **A cover holds a title and a subtitle, nothing more.** The first paragraph
 * under the opening `#` is the subtitle; every other block moves past the
 * cover, because a list on a title page is a list that belongs on the next
 * slide. A divider works the same way: the slide is the title, and the
 * section's blocks follow on content slides of their own.
 *
 * **Content that does not fit continues on the next slide**, titled with
 * `(계속)`. The line count is `layout.ts`'s estimate, in the same
 * character-width currency `write/table.ts` uses for column widths.
 *
 * **Blocks are flattened to lines before anything is packed.** A list becomes one
 * piece per item with its marker already resolved, which is what lets a numbered
 * list be split across two slides and still count 4, 5, 6 rather than starting
 * again at 1. Only a table stays whole, and it splits by row with its header
 * repeated.
