/**
 * The presentation AST — what sits between the Markdown document and the XML.

 * new slide archetype is a planning decision (what does this content *mean*?)
 * and a rendering decision (what shapes say that?), and holding both in one
 * module is how the original single-file renderer reached a thousand lines.
