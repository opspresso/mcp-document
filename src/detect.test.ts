/**
 * What a pile of bytes is, and — when it is nothing this reads — what the
 * refusal says.
 *
 * The refusals are tested as carefully as the successes. A model that is told
 * "unsupported" spends another turn guessing; one that is told "this is an
 * Excel workbook" or "use fetch_document for web pages" does not. Every case
 * below is a wrong answer somebody would otherwise have to debug from a tool
 * result that said nothing.
