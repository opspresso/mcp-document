/**
 * The zip container, which DOCX and HWPX both are.
 *
 * A zip is the one input shape here where a small upload can ask for an
 * arbitrarily large allocation: the compression ratio belongs to whoever built
 * the archive. So nothing is inflated until the central directory has been read
 * and counted — `listEntries` walks it with a filter that inflates nothing, and
 * `readEntries` only runs once those numbers are inside the budget.
 *
 * Entry names are never used as paths. Reading is by exact name
 * (`word/document.xml`), and writing composes the names itself, so there is no
 * point at which one reaches a filesystem. The traversal check below is not
 * defending a directory; it is refusing an archive that was built to be
 * mishandled, which is a thing worth knowing about a document.
